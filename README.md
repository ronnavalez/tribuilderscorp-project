Tri Builders Corp – Sample Construction Company Website
This project was originally built for my Web Development 2 course at Red River College, but at the same time, my friend asked me to make a sample website for her construction/renovation company — so I figured, why not both?

What It Does
The site includes all the basic pages you’d expect from a small business website:

Home
About
Gallery
Reviews (requires login to leave a review)
Contact form
Login/Logout system for users

It's fully functional for demo purposes, showing what a simple contractor business site might look like.

Tech Stack
Built with:

HTML & CSS – for structure and styling
PHP – for backend functionality and authentication
JavaScript – light DOM interaction
MySQL – (if used) for storing user info and reviews

Features
User authentication (login/logout)
Protected reviews page – only logged-in users can leave a review
Simple responsive layout
Static image gallery

Still Needs Work
This was one of my earlier projects — it works, but it’s pretty basic. I’m planning to:
Refactor the frontend using React
Improve styling and responsiveness
Add form validation and cleaner error handling
Possibly hook it up with a proper backend or CMS
